Selecator Privacy Policy
========================

Selecator ("the app") provides functionality to select and relocate pictures on your Android device directory structure.

To achieve this, the app requires full disk access, so that the image files can be moved between the selected folders. Android does not grant file movement without it.

The app does only store your preferences (path to the directories) and accesses the images only to show them in the app.

The app especially **does not**:
- upload your files to the web or share it with others
- access any other files than the images in the directories you selected
- modify the images (apart from moving them obviously)

If you want to report an error or if you have general feedback or questions, please feel free to open tickets in this GitHub repository.

This policy might get updated when new features get added. So, if you really care, please watch it for changes.
