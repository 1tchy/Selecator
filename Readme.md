Android App "Selecator"
=======================
> Lets you select and relocate your best pictures to another directory.

With Selecator you can select and relocate (move) your images in your directory structure.
For example, when you want to move your best family moments to a folder shared (by other apps) with your family. Or when you're on a trip and want to share the best pictures with your friends.

Just select two directories on your device and swipe the images back and forth.
